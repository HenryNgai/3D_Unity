## Stuff I Should Do
1. Complete 3D scene ✅ <-- Imported Asset
2. Player Movement ✅
    - Smooth Physics ✅ 
    - 360 Movement ✅
    - Camera Movement ✅
3. 3D Character ✅
    - Rigged body (Model) ✅
    - Animations ✅
4. WebGL Build ✅
5. Sounds ❓

## Note:
Runs smoothly on WebGL but movement feels "artificial".
Should robably take a look at current games and see how 3rd person can be implemented more smoothly.


## Build
1. Import project into Unity (Add new project in Unity Hub)
2. Convert all materials into your unity pipeline Edit -> Rendering -> Materials -> Convert
3. Build and Run (WebGL for quick testing)
4. Browser should open with localhost and port with WebGL
